## Name
Franco Voisard 


Hi there! I'm @Franmvoisard, a Software Engineer with a passion for building great things. On my GitHub account, you'll find a variety of projects that showcase my skills in languages such as C#, C++, and Kotlin. I'm always looking for new opportunities to collaborate and learn, so don't hesitate to reach out!

I have more than 7 years of experience across more than 17 projects using Unity and now Unreal for videogames. Worked in companies big as etermax as a Platform Engineer (Yes! The creators of Trivia Crack and Word Crack) and small companies.

Most of my day-to-day work is proprietary or under NDA, so unfortunately I cannot share it. However, I'm working hard on my free time to bring some cool projects and make them available for everybody to inspect them.

In the meantime, feel free to reach out and let's talk.
